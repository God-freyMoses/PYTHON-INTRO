# Week 7 – Kicking Off the Advanced Phase: Diving into Python 🐍

Welcome to **Week 7** of App Academy — the beginning of the **Advanced Stage** of my coding journey!

This week marks a big transition. I’m leaving behind the familiar territory of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and jumping into something brand new: **Python Development**.

## 🚀 What I'm Learning

Starting from scratch with Python is both exciting and challenging. Although the syntax and style are different from JavaScript, I’m finding that many programming fundamentals carry over. My previous experience is helping me adapt quickly and confidently.

Here’s why this week is a milestone:

- **Brand new language** – I’m learning to think and solve problems in Python.
- **Accelerated pace** – I’m building a strong Python foundation in just three weeks.
- **Personal growth** – This is a real challenge, but I’m ready for it.

## 💡 Staying Motivated

Learning a new language at this speed isn’t easy, but I’m not alone.

I have:
- Support from the App Academy team
- A community of peers learning alongside me
- The skills and habits I’ve built so far

I’m taking it step by step, staying curious, and trusting the process. I’m excited, a bit nervous, but most of all — ready for what’s next.

Let’s do this — Python, here I come! 🔥🐍
